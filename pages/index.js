        <Paragraph>
            Diogo is a freelance and a full-stack developer based in Lisbon, Portugal, with a passion for coding and curious about new technologies. 
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
            He enjoys finding bugs and to frustrate with code, he likes to tackle problems and spend some time trying to understand what is causing them. He is curious about cybersecurity and tries to further his knowledge in it when there's time for it. When not online, he loves hanging out with friends, gaming (RPG and strategy fan), watch japanese animation, to travel and he is obsessed towards Pokemon, on an unhealthy scale.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
             The technologies that he usually uses are Javascript, React.js, Next.js, MongoDB and Express.js. Although all of this, he is not shy of a new challenge and to look for new things that may awake his passion for this area.

                      At Sibs I started in a team to verify personal documentation and to check if the regulations imposed by Banco de Portugal (Portugal National Bank) were being respected. I was in two teams, one was for opening and the other for maintenance of bank accounts. After a while I was put in another team, to pledge bank accounts when receiving instructions to do it, by the IRS and Social Security. And finally, I had to deal with inheritance and heir qualification, for that I had to work side by side with the juridical department of that same bank.
                      All of their tools were in-house, as such, I cannot disclose information about it. Sorry for the inconvenience.

                  After being hit by Covid-19 and the quarantine, I decided to take this bootcamp. It was focused in Objective-C, Git and Linux Command Line. Due to quarantine, it was not possible to continue further development at this bootcamp.
