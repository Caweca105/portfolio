          PokeJoker was a three-man project roughly based on 'Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'. Our theme was Pokemon questions. There are three difficulties, each one of them has a different music, questions and cinematography based on the theme. There is a points system and a pikachu button that randomly eliminates one question, but if you do not use those pikachu it will give bonus points.
